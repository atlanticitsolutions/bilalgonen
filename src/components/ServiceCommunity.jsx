          I served as a judge in the State Science Day 2020 organized by Ohio
          Academy of Science. State Science Day is one of the largest of its
          kind in the nation. Drawing upon a base of over 25,000 students at
          1,000+ local school science fairs, 797 students in grades 5–12 from
          258 schools were evaluated on their scientific research and
          communication skills. First held in 1949, the 72nd Annual State
          Science Day is sponsored by: The Ohio Academy of Science, The American
          Electric Power Foundation, Battelle Memorial Institute, CAS, Charles
          River Laboratories, Kokosing, Ohio EPA–The Ohio Environmental
          Education Fund, Ohio Tuition Trust Authority–College Advantage, and
          The Ohio State University. I reviewed and scored 3 high school
          projects.

          I am a graduate of The 2017 FBI Citizens’ Academy Foundation of
          Cincinnati. (4/2017 – 6/2017).
          <br />I attended the FBI Citizens&#8217; Academy program for 8 weeks.
          The classes were 5:30pm-9:00pm on Thursdays. The Citizens&#8217;
          Academy is a stimulating program that gives business, religious,
          civic, and community leaders an inside look at the FBI. During the
          Academy, students participate in firearms demonstrations and practical
          problems involving the collection and preservation of physical
          evidence; are introduced to the structure and operation of an FBI
          field office and resident agency; are provided an overview of the
          legal basis for the FBI&#8217;s jurisdiction and issues relating to
          congressional oversight; and learn the services the FBI provides to
          local and state law enforcement agencies. The Academy classes are
          taught by FBI staff, and/or others deemed appropriate by the
          division&#8217;s Special Agent in Charge (SAC). I am also a member of
          FBI Cincinnati Citizens Academy Alumni Association.
